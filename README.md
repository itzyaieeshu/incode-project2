# Incode - Project2
## Mr. coffee

### Installation
You can use any local server to run this program. However, I would recommend live-server to run this program
If you don't have live-server installed already, try install using the below code.

***npm install -g live-server***

Navigate to the project folder using cmd line, then start server by running the below code.

***live-server***
